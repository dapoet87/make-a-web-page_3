      This is the Poetic Mind of Jontae Hall<br />
      I am not <em>100% sure</em> of what is to go here, so I will
      just try to demonstrate things that I've learned in this
      lesson. I am excited to maybe one day be able to work on my
      on <a href="www.yourbrotherskeepers.org">website</a><br />
      This is awesome. Here is a picture of me and my friends at a
      health workshop. That's me sitting in the center.'<img src=

      I really enjoy leading workshops and seminars to help others.
      This is why We started the non profit called, Brother's

        1. Components of the Web<br />
        2. The web is <em>basically</em> built using:<br />
        People<br />
        Computers<br />
        The actual internet<br />
        HTTP<br />
        Servers(these are a bunch of computers that host files(i.e

          <strong>Tags and Elements</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          A tag is a hidden keyword that tells the browser how to
          format content. An element consists of an opening tag,
          content, and a closing tag.
        </p>Some examples are the bold tag, b, and the emphasis
        tag, em. There are other types of tags that don't need to
        be closed. The br tag adds a line break. The img tag is
        used to embed images, like I added above. The a tag is used
        to add links. Inline vs Block Some tags like b, em, and
        even br are inline tags, which means they are normally
        displayed without line breaks. Other tags like p and div,
        are block tags. That means they are their own elements and
        can have a specified height and width.
